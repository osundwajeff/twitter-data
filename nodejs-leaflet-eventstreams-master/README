--nodejs-leaflet-eventstreams-

This webapp makes use of node, event-streams and leaflet. 

It queries the Twitter Streaming API with location 
so that only tweets that are geotagged with coordinates
are returned. 

The most recent tweets are pulled in and displayed on the
map.  There is no database- tweets are displayed as they come in. 

Much of the server side is based on nodejs-stream

Leaflet is a fantastic mapping library http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/

More deets on the twitter streamin api for location

To use, download the code and enter your twitter username and password in the 
config.js file.  Install node and any dependencies using npm.  

>node server.js 
This will start the node server, the go to localhost:8000 in the browser
to see the world map and watch it populate. Sometimes it takes a few 
minutes for the API to fetch the tweets.
